# Aqueduct

**Aqueduct** is an experimental project aiming to connect the **Design Tokens Community Group (DTCG) standard** with real-world tools.  

The goal is to use a DTCG-compliant JSON file as the single source of truth, and make it possible to:

- Import and synchronize tokens into **Figma** (Variables & Styles)  
- Transform tokens into **CSS** or other formats  
- Provide a foundation for future extensions (other design tools, platforms, or editors)  

This repository is still in an early stage.
